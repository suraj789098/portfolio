Some books change people’s lives, some give us a healthy lifestyle and some heal the soul.</p><p>Showing your work is a personal manifesto on how to get creative work done. Austin Kleon explains the perspective on doing the work you love. The book is full of quotes with impactful ideas. Before starting any work, we should think about ideas thoroughly. When we start thinking there are many possibilities as beginners, but experts have few ideas. We need not be geniuses to succeed in life. We should focus on our process, the struggles and influences are also shown. We should document our work. The best way of making a record of our work is by journaling, which helps us to see our progress, which helps us to keep track of our work and make the process even more creative. When we make little progress in the work, we should take feedback. We should also listen to other’s ideas and if they want help from us we should help them. We should share our secret of work with the person who listens to us.</p><p>I learnt how to share my ideas, processes, and work for free online in order to reach an audience interested in the same topics we are, and how this might enhance our lives. We can share our work because newcomers can easily assist other newcomers, and we don&rsquo;t have to be experts. Following the completion of the book, I began writing blogs. It compelled me to share my ideas and my work. It is preferable to learn something and share it than to learn nothing. We should present our work and ideas in a way that is appealing to others and easy to comprehend.The book explains the procedures to be followed in order for us to be successful in our jobs. I learned how sharing our work can help us achieve in our studies.</p><p>Because the book is brief, we could finish it in one week. When we achieve victory,
we should not quit working. Even if we are successful, we should continue to practise. Even if we don&rsquo;t succeed, we should work hard. This is an optimistic book that gave me useful advice on how to better myself.</p><p>Keep working hard&mldr; Keep reading books&mldr;</p></div></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2021 <a href>Suraj Nayak</a></span>
