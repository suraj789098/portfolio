Security has become a major concern in today&amp;rsquo;s world. We don&amp;rsquo;t think about how secure our data is over the network and between the users. But, it has a complex mechanism to provide security. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how this security mechanism is achieved.
Cryptography is the division of computer science which is used to implement the security mechanism. It is the science of protecting information by transforming it into a secure format for protecting digital data.</description></item><item><title>Show Your Work</title><link>/posts/first-post/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 May 2021 09:37:09 +0530</pubDate><guid>/posts/first-post/</guid><description>Books play an important role in a person’s life in many ways.

Although the term often refers to the study of three-dimensional computer graphics, it also encompasses two-dimensional graphics and image processing.
There are many applications of computer graphics like:
Print design Digital art Special effects Video games Visual effects Computer-aided design and many more OpenGL is a cross-language, cross-platform application programming interface for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics.</description></item><item><title/><link>/posts/archives/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/archives/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
